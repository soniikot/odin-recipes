    <h1>Norvegian Stew or Lapskaus</h1>
    <img src="img/stew.jpeg" alt="diced potatoes, beef and carrots">
    <p>No matter the season or the weather, Norwegians tend to enjoy outdoor activities which often includes preparing the meal over an open fire outdoors. “Lapskaus” is a frequently made outdoor dish but it is also perfect as a warming indoor meal during autumn and winter.

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>900 g beef</li>
        <li>1 big onion of leek</li>
        <li>600 gr of potatoes</li>
        <li>5 carrots</li>
        <li>1/2 of celery root</li>
        <li>1 rutabaga or turnip</li>
        <li>800 ml beef stock</li>
        <li>100 ml red wine</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>4 thyme stems</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat in small pieces, ideally around 1-2 cm.</li>
        <li>Chop the onion in small pieces (approx 1 cm).</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp butter and the olive oil in a frying pan and quickly color the meat. You probably need to fry them in 2-3 turns as you don’t want to add too much meat in the pan at once (it risks boiling instead of frying…). Remove the meat from the pan as soon as it has colored.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining butter in a stewpan and fry the onions at medium heat for a few minutes. Add the meat and the flour and mix well while cooking for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in, little by little, the beef stock and wine while stirring.</li>
        <li>Add the bay leaves and thyme, cover the pan and let it simmer until the meat is tender (around 1 hour). Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the meat is cooking wash, peel and cut all the vegetables in 1×1 cm pieces.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is tender, remove the bay leaves and thyme stems and add the vegetables. Cook until the vegetables are tender (approx 20-30 minutes). Stir occasionally.</li>

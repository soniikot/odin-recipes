    <h1>Gravlax</h1>
    <img src="/img/gravlax.jpeg" alt="piece of rye bread with spread, cured salmon and dill">
    <p>I think of making my own gravlax — the Nordic sugar-salt cured salmon — as the gentle, blue-square cooking analog of an intermediate ski trail: It’s mostly easy, but requires some experience. While butchering a whole salmon and cold smoking what you’ve butchered are also exhilarating milestones in the life of an advancing home cook (both a little farther up the mountain and a little steeper on the run down), buying a nice fillet and burying it in salt, sugar and a carpet of chopped fresh dill for a few days is a great confidence-building day on the slopes, so to speak. The cured gravlax will last a solid five days once sliced, in the refrigerator. If a whole side of salmon is more than you need at once, the rest freezes very satisfactorily.

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1side clean, fresh and fat Alaskan king salmon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of finely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 bunches dill</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cure the salmon: Lay salmon skin-side down, flesh-side up in a glass or stainless-steel baking dish. (A large lasagna dish works well.) In a small bowl, toss together the salt, sugar and pepper until blended. Sprinkle the mixture over the salmon evenly, with abandon, until fully covered, as if under a blanket of snow. Use all of it.</li>
        <li>Spread all the chopped dill on top of the cure-covered salmon to make a thick, grassy carpet.</li>
        <li>Lay plastic wrap or parchment paper over the salmon to cover and press down, then place a heavy weight — such as a 2-gallon zip-top bag filled with water — on top, to weigh heavily on the curing fish. Refrigerate just like this, without disturbing, for 5 days, turning the salmon over midway through the cure — on Day 3 — then covering and weighting it again.</li>
        <li>Remove salmon from the cure, which has now become liquid, brushing off the dill with a paper towel, then set fillet on a cutting board.</li>
